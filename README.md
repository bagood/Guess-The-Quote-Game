# Guess-The-Quote-Game

A simple attempt to guess a quote from highly renowned people would be the first step to becoming a renowned person.

This project involves scraping a website for data collection and then storing it on a CSV file to be used for the guessing games. The scraping was done using BeautifulSoup and the target scraping website was http://quotes.toscrape.com/. This project helped me understand the process of data scraping and how important scraping could be.

## Executions

Collect and store the data
```
python3 GAQ_scrape.py
